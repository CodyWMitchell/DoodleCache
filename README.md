# DoodleCache

This is my app for Senior Projects!
It works with maps, drawing, and geo-location!

Currently hosted @ doodlecache.herokuapp.com

# What it does

The app allows multiple users to draw in real-time on a map together. The x,y canvas coordinates are translated to latitude and longitude.

The app will automatically center the canvas on the user's location, so that nearby users can see eachother's drawings.
